# Cost Impact Analysis (Simulation Framework)

Assume:
- Cost of unplanned failure event: $50,000
- Preventive intervention cost: $4,000
- False positive operational friction: $1,000

Expected monthly avoided cost can be estimated using confusion matrix outcomes and incident rates from production logs.
